# Python Code Examples

Welcome to the Python directory! This directory contains a collection of Python code files.

## Prerequisites

Before you run the Python code examples, make sure you have the necessary tools installed on your system:

### **Mac, Windows (Preferred: WSL), Linux:**

1. **Python (Python Interpreter):**
   - Visit the [Python website](https://www.python.org/).
   - Download and install the latest version suitable for your platform.

## Running the Code

To run the Python code examples:

1. **Run Python:**
   - Navigate to the directory containing the code.
   - Run the code using Python: 
     - For Python 2: `python filename.py`.
     - For Python 3: `python3 filename.py`.

## Alternative (if you are unable to install Python locally):

If you are unable to install Python on your system, you can use online Python interpreters that don't require a login:

1. **Using Online Python Interpreters (No Login Required):**
   - Open your web browser.
   - Visit an online Python interpreter website such as [Repl.it](https://replit.com/languages/python3), [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/), or [Trinket](https://trinket.io/python3).
   - Copy and paste the code from the Python file (`filename.py`) into the online interpreter.
   - Click the "Run" or equivalent button to execute the code.

Note: Online Python interpreters are convenient for running Python code without the need to install Python locally.
