# Java is ~~Awesome~~Bloated!

Welcome to the Java code examples directory! This directory contains a collection of Java code files.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system:

### **Mac, Windows, Linux:**

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK):**
   - Download and install the latest version of JDK from the official Oracle website or use an open-source JDK distribution.

## Running the Code

To run the plain Java code:

1. **Using the Command Line:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory containing the Java file (`filename.java`).
   - Compile the Java code using the `javac` command:
     - `javac filename.java`
   - Run the compiled Java program using the `java` command:
     - `java filename`

That's it! The Java code in `filename.java` will be compiled and executed, and you'll see the output in the terminal.

## Alternative (if you encounter issues with command line):

If you face difficulties using the command line to compile and run Java code, you can use an online Java compiler.

1. **Using an Online Java Compiler (Alternative):**
   - Open your web browser.
   - Choose one of the online Java compilers available such as [Programiz JAVA Compiler](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/online-compiler/) or [Online GDB](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_java_compiler).
   - Copy and paste the code from the Java file (`filename.java`) into the online compiler.
   - Click the "Run" or "Compile" button to execute the code.

Note: The online Java compiler is a convenient option if you encounter issues with the command line or simply prefer a web-based solution for running Java code.
