# Rust Code Examples

Welcome to the Rust code directory! This directory contains a collection of Rust code files.

## Prerequisites

Before you run the Rust code examples, make sure you have the necessary tools installed on your system:

### **Mac, Windows (Preferred: WSL), Linux:**

1. **Rust (Rust Compiler):**
   - Visit the [Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
   - Download and install Rust, including the `rustc` compiler.

## Running the Code

To run the Rust code examples:

1. **Compile and Run:**
   - Navigate to the directory containing the code.
   - Compile the code using `rustc`:
     - Build: `rustc filename.rs`
     - Run: `./filename` (the compiled executable).

## Alternative (if you encounter environment setup issues):

If you face difficulties setting up your environment or prefer a quick way to run the code without installing Rust locally, you can use online Rust compilers.

1. **Using Online Rust Compilers (Alternative):**
   - Open your web browser.
   - Visit an online Rust compilers website such as [Play Rust](https://play.rust-lang.org/).
   - Copy and paste the code from the Rust file (`filename.rs`) into the online interpreter.
   - Click the "Run" or equivalent button to execute the code.

Note: Online Rust compilers are convenient for running Rust code without the need to install Rust locally.
