# FOSS CDN (Can't Decide Name) v0.1.0-alpha

## 🚀 **Welcome to the Beginner-Friendly Bug Hunt!**

If you want to improve your coding skills, you're in the right place. This is an open-source project designed for beginners to learn by doing. We've purposely added bugs to some code examples, and we're inviting you to fix them!

## **Project Overview**

### 🔍 **What's Inside?**

Inside this repository, you'll find code files with intentional bugs. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to:

- 🐞 Identify and fix these bugs.
- 📝 Explain the issues and your solutions.
- 📚 Write clear commit messages to document your changes.

🤓 While knowing a programming language is helpful, it's not required. What's essential is understanding Git and GitHub.

## **Prerequisites**

1. 🧑 💻 Basic understanding of Git and GitHub.
2. 🤓 Familiarity with at least one programming language (basic knowledge is enough).
3. 🌐 Internet connection for downloading resources.

## **Contributing**

We welcome contributions from the community to help identify and fix bugs in the code. Here's how you can get involved:

### **Adding New Buggy Codes**

If you want to add more buggy code examples to this repository, follow these steps:

1. 🍴 Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. 💻 Clone your forked repository to your computer.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fossinit.git
