## Welcome to the Beginner-Friendly C/C++ Bug Hunt!

If you're looking to improve your C and C++ programming skills, you're in the right place. This open-source project is designed to help beginners learn by doing. We've intentionally introduced bugs, errors, and issues into code examples, and we're inviting you to fix them!

## Project Overview

### What's Inside?

Inside this repository, you'll find a collection of code files filled with intentionally introduced bugs, errors, and issues. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to:

- Identify and fix these bugs
- Provide clear explanations of the issues and your solutions
- Write proper commit messages to document your changes

This project is perfect for beginners who want to practice coding, learn problem-solving skills, and get hands-on experience with C and C++. Even if you can't fix a bug, explaining what's wrong and how you think it can be resolved is a valuable contribution.

### Prerequisites
1. Basic Knowledge of git, GitHub, C and C++
2. Compilers like gcc, g++ or clang, clang++ on your local system
3. Internet Connection for downloading resources
