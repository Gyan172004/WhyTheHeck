# Why The Heck

## 🚀 **Welcome to the Beginner-Friendly Bug Hunt!**

If you want to improve your coding skills, you're in the right place. This is an open-source project designed for beginners to learn by doing. We've purposely added bugs to some code examples, and we're inviting you to fix them!

## **Project Overview**

### 🔍 **What's Inside?**

Inside this repository, you'll find code files with intentional bugs. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to:

- 🐞 Identify and fix these bugs.
- 📝 Explain the issues and your solutions.
- 📚 Write clear commit messages to document your changes.

🤓 While knowing a programming language is helpful, it's not required. What's essential is understanding Git and GitHub.
